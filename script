What shapes have the same area and perimeter?
What size equilateral triangle would?
How about other shapes?
There is one trivial solution for all shapes, zero,
but what about other, non-trivial solutions.
Let's start with a triangle.
<triangle>
First step, construct a triangle.
To find the area, we need the height.
Splitting the triangle down the middle shows a hidden right triangle.
In order to use the Pythagorean theorem, we need to know the values.
The hypotenuse is the triangle's side length,
the bottom is half of the triangle's side length.
The side on the right is the height, which is what we need to find.
Now by substituting the values into the Pythagorean theorem,
we find the height of the triangle.
We are left with two S squared variables, which we can simplify.
Then to find h we can take a squared root.
Since the height is a length the plus or minus can be ignored.
Now we are ready to start finding the triangle.
Substituting height into the area for a triangle formula,
provides a formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.
This formula could be simplified further,
but the S's will be canceled in the next step regardless.
Set the equations equal, and cancel some terms.
After simplifying the radical, we are left with a final answer.
Using the formula's provides the same answer
for both area and perimeter, a good sign.

A similar method should work for other shapes.
Let's try adding a side.
<square>
For a square the area is S squared,
and the perimeter is 4 S.
Setting the equal dividing by S leaves a solution, s = 4.
</square>
The next shape to try is the pentagon.
<pentagon>
However there is not a clear way forward.
One idea is to add 5 isosceles triangles.
There are no right triangles,
and the splitting trick leaves too many unknown angles.
</pentagon>
Continuing adding one side brings us to the hexagon.
<hexagon>
The hexagon is made of six equilateral triangles.
Our previous formula for a triangle can be repurposed.
Perimeter is six times the side length.
Set them equal, and cancel the 6, then the S.
Solve for S, and we have a solution for the hexagon.
</hexagon>
How far does this go?
Will there be a pattern, or will each shape have to solved like this?
Lets take this to the limit, a circle.
<circle>
Instead of side length, radius will be used.
As is familiar by now, the area and perimeter formulas are used.
Set them equal, divide common factors, simplify, and solve.
The circle has a radius of two.
</circle>
Instead of continuing on, with a heptagon, octagon, nonagon, and on,
maybe we should look for patterns, there must be a regularities.
<general_triangle>
Lets take our ngon, and split it into triangles.
The area is n times the area of one triangle.
The perimeter is n times the base of one triangle.
This means that the area and base of each triangle must be the same.
If the height of the triangle is two it will cancel with the two in the area formula,
leaving a result of b, the base.
This makes sense, considering how the circle had a radius of two.
Now we know that the height of the triangle is two, but how can that help us find b?
</general_triangle>
<trig>
Lets split our triangle in half, to get a right triangle.
After labeling what we know, the Pythagorean theorem won't help;
there are too many unknowns.
But we also know the angle, and trigonometry will help here,
the tangent function in particular.
The tangent of angle theta is the opposite side over the adjacent side.
Substituting our variables leads us to: tan theta equals b over 4.
Multiplying by 4 gives us the solution to all of these problems.
The side length is four times the tangent of tau divided by twice the number of sides.
